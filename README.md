grabimages - The Brandon Sanderson Edition
==========

Complete overhaul of goutham2027's source code to parse artwork from Brandon Sanderson's website's artwork section.
Changed the lookup string and added the ability to scroll through all the pages for a specific book + command line prompt for indication of progress  (it can take a moderately long time to download all the high res images)

# Usage
Just get the url from one of the artwork pages in https://brandonsanderson.com/artwork/. Note that the url needs to end with `pages` for it to work (right click bottom pages links and copy link)

*temporary readme, more detailed explaination sometime in the future*
